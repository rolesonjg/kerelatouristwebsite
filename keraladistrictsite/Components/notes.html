    <p>Dear Team,

        Thank you for providing the requirements for Assignment #01 on designing a website for Kerala Tourism. I've
        outlined the basic structure and elements for each of the required pages below.

        Login Page
        Username and Password input fields
        Login button
        Link to the SignUp Page

        SignUp Page
        Fields for Name, Email, Username, Password
        Sign-Up button
        Link to the Login Page

        Home Page
        Header with the website name and navigation links
        Hero section with a captivating image and brief introduction to Kerala
        Featured destinations or promotional content
        Footer with contact information and social media links

        District Page
        Header with navigation links
        List of 14 districts as clickable links (e.g., Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, etc.)
        Each district link leads to the respective Individual District Page

        Individual District Pages (5 pages for 5 districts, but the structure is the same for all)
        Header with navigation links
        District's name and an attractive image
        Short description of the district
        A section showcasing 2-5 hot tourist spots with images and names
        Footer with contact information and social media links

        General Notes:

        Ensure responsive design so that the website looks good on various screen sizes.
        Use HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
        Consider adding animations or other interactive elements to make the website more engaging.
        Since form validation is not required for this assignment, focus on the layout and design aspects.

        Once you have completed the design and coding, make sure to test the website on different browsers and devices
        to ensure compatibility. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.

        Good luck with your assignment, and I hope your website promotes the beauty of Kerala effectively!

        Best regards,
        [Your Name]</p>
